# My VEX CADs

### This repository contains CAD models of all my VEX robots for the 2020-2023 seasons.

The robot CAD models are exact recreations of their real-life counterparts, and represent the robots in their final forms at the end of each season.
All models were created using Autodesk Inventor using the [VEX CAD Library](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor).

| Robot               | Year      | Competition Recap |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| ChangeUpFinal       | 2020-2021 | Attended one competition with little success, was later improved while waiting for next season to start. Only robot this season.
| TippingPointFinal   | 2021-2022 | Attended 5 competitions and constantly placed high in quals ranking, but often lost in elims due to outside factors. Attended state championship with moderate success. Only robot this season.
| SpinUpCatapult      | 2022-2023 | Attended multiple competitions throughout the season including WPI signature event, constantly placing high in quals and skills. Qualified team for state championship, and won 6 total awards.
| SpinUpFlywheel      | 2022-2023 | Second robot of the season. Attended state championship with moderate success, but eliminated without qualifying for worlds.

This repo also includes various custom parts as well as the field CAD for each game and renders of each robot.

Except for ChangeUpFinal, all movement-based constraints and other important parts start with an exclamation point: `! name`. This allows the relationships and parts to easily be searched.
